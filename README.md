# AirBnB clone - The console

## Description 
  
This project is designed to Write a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects.It is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

## Requirements
### Python Scripts

    * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    * All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
    * All your files should end with a new line
    * The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    * Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7 or more)
    * All your files must be executable
    * The length of your files will be tested using wc
    * All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    * All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    * All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    * A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Unit Tests

    * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    * All your files should end with a new line
    * All your test files should be inside a folder tests
    * You have to use the unittest module
    * All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
    * All your test files and folders should start by test_
    * Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
    * All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
    * You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
    * All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    * All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    * All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

## How the project works

   * first the project displays a prompt message for the user
   * It then reads the strings inputed by the user
   * It then splits the string into words
   * It takes the first word as a command and then finds the appropriate do handler to execute the command
   * if the first word is not identfied, it calls the default handler to execute the user instruction
   * Finally after execution, the final output will be displayed back to the user

---

## modes of operation

The project works in interactive mode and non-interactive mode as shown below.

### interactive modes of operaton

The interactive mode allows the user to write the command once they are in the prompt in the interactive way as shown in the example below


``` help command ```:
```
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  clear  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 

```

### non-interactive modes of operation

The non-interactive mode allows the user to write the command once they are outside of the prompt just like any linux command as shown in the example below

``` help command ```:

```
Grillz@ADMINRG-B42TJRE MINGW64 /e/docs/study/soft/ALX/Projects/ref_projects/AirBnB_clone (main)
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)  

```

---

## Usage

   * Download the source code from the github repository
   * Run the project by writing ./console.py if you want to execute in the interactive mode 
   * While the system prompts the user, write the required command
   * Or run the project by concatenating other commands with ./console.py if you want in non-interactive mode
   * Finally the system will display the approprate out put to the user
   * When you want to exit the system, type quit or EOF in the interactive mode
